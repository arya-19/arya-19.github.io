                    Out of all the metropolitans in India, Delhi has it good
                    when it comes to weekend getaways. From lively and popular
                    tourist spots to breathtaking offbeat destinations, the
                    National Capital is blessed to have a plethora of places to
                    visit near Delhi for weekends. The fast-paced life in Delhi
                    calls for a quick weekend getaway trip. Thankfully, there
                    are plenty of hill stations to help you rejuvenate. Now, if
                    your trip is planned and you are going with your family, it
                    makes sense to opt for a tour package; it saves on the time
                    and stress of trip planning.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Spain is an exotic country that boasts cinematic coastlines,
                    dramatic landscapes and unrivalled skylines clubbed along
                    with vibrant heritage, relaxed lifestyle, friendly
                    inhabitants, world-famous festivities and a lip-smacking
                    cuisine that compliments the culture and its people.
                    Exploring Spain painted in Red would reveal whole new shades
                    of it. Painted in beautiful arrays of hues, Spain will boast
                    a whole new aura to the exploration of this land along with
                    the festive tour of La Tomatina! The Bollywood movie
                    ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Doobara’ set a whole new imagery for
                    exploring Spain thereby increasing the number of Indian
                    Bollywood fan tourists to follow the trails!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The records were observed to rise up so drastically that the
                    movie was also addressed by the Spanish tourism boards. With
                    the true hype of the festival of La Tomatina portrayed in
                    this movie, the attention of the curious explorers was
                    grabbed on so strongly that La Tomatina became a part of so
                    many bucket lists from that year! To understand the real
                    insights of Spain’s Tomatina, understanding the festival and
                    what it has to offer is very necessary. Designing travel and
                    exploring Spain along with the celebration of such a unique
                    festival gave rise to the perfectly matched ideology of our
                    La Tomatina Festival tour!

                    The Andaman Islands are full of tourist attractions,
                    pristine beaches and a slew of exhilarating water
                    activities. One of the most popular water activities is
                    snorkelling in Andaman which offers people the opportunity
                    to witness the beauty of sea life and to admire the textured
                    coral reefs that surround the islands. In fact, we wouldn’t
                    be exaggerating when we say that snorkelling in Andaman and
                    Nicobar is an activity that will leave you mesmerized.

                    With its spacious square, winding streets, nightlife,

                    The Ocean or the Sea, used in the same reference in North
                    American English has continued inspiring humans for time
                    immemorial now. Be it the episode of ‘Samudra Manthan’ or
                    churning of the milk ocean in Hindu mythology, the great
                    explorers like Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama
                    setting sail in search of new lands or even some of our
                    greatest poets like Matthew Arnold and Gurudev Rabindranath
                    Tagore composing some eternally beautiful poems like ‘Dover
                    Beach’ and ‘Sail Away’ respectively. Even today the best
                    residential properties and the best hotel rooms are
                    considered to be the sea-facing ones. Our oceans cover more
                    than 70% of the earth’s surface; how could they not have
                    such a great influence on our life? And therefore to
                    celebrate the oceans on earth and in our life, we celebrate
                    the ‘World Ocean Day’, every year on the 8th of June.

                    It was back in school that we all learnt, ‘Man is a social
                    animal’. In the due course of human evolution, we have
                    always lived in groups, forming communities and eventually
                    setting up various social structures and institutions in our
                    society. A deadly virus has hit the very basis of our social
                    life and has forced us to follow ‘Social Distancing’.
                    However, we humans are just not made to distance ourselves
                    from each other and cannot ever live an isolated life. Until
                    an effective drug or a vaccine against the Coronavirus is
                    clearly in sight and reaches out to everyone across the
                    globe, it goes without saying, Social Distancing or rather
                    more appropriately Physical Distancing is going to be the
                    new normal for all of us. By now, we have all come to
                    realise that unlike in B.C. and A.D. until the beginning of
                    this year, life will be defined and chronicled in B.C.
                    (Before Corona) and A.C. (After Corona) hereafter. With some
                    experts claiming that the virus is here to stay and we got
                    to learn to live with it, will life post-lockdown be really
                    manageable or will it be unimaginable? Or who knows, it may
                    even take us by surprise by being unimaginably manageable!

                    Known for its breathtaking landscapes, lovely walking
                    trails, and the Shyok River, Nubra Valley is no less than
                    paradise on Earth. Living in remoteness for most of the
                    year, the valley comes to life during the summers. The
                    grandiose Y-shaped Nubra Valley is, in fact, among the best
                    places to visit in Leh Ladakh. Surrounded by rocky boulders
                    and snow-clad mountains, the valley is a hotspot for
                    trekkers and adventure travellers.

                  <p>
                    Take a trip to one of the most isolated valleys of North
                    Ladakh to imbibe the beauty and serenity of this heavenly
                    place in its purest form. Nubra Valley lies at a height of
                    about 10,000 ft above sea level and is located at a distance
                    of 150 km from Leh. The journey to the valley is an
                    experience in itself as it allows you to experience the best
                    of both nature and the simplistic lifestyles of the people
                    residing in this beautiful place.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Switzerland is one of the most beautiful places on earth
                    that is home to several shimmering lakes, medieval towns,
                    high peaks, and the highest mountain range in all of Europe
                    (The Alps). All of this together with a plethora of
                    breathtaking places makes Switzerland a top-notch travel
                    destination for every traveller. But this time when you buy
                    a Switzerland tour package, don’t restrict your trip to just
                    sightseeing; make sure to spare a day or two for the
                    thrilling and impressive journey to Jungfraujoch. Nicknamed
                    as “Top of Europe”, this place is a heaven for adventure
                    junkies and nature lovers. Perching at a height of 3,454
                    metres, Jungfraujoch is one of the highest tourist
                    destinations of the continent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The highlights of this place include the Aletsch Glacier,
                    Jungfraujoch Railway Station, hiking hut-to-hut and the
                    popular Ice Palace. Jungfraujoch is one of those spots of
                    Switzerland that is overlooked by most travellers. This
                    Bernese Alps’ summit unites the magnificent backdrop of ice
                    and rocks with the awe-inspiring sights spread all over. The
                    weather of Jungfraujoch, not surprisingly, is on the colder
                    side throughout the year. So if you are planning on visiting
                    here during your Swiss trip then do pack a good number of
                    warmers.
